# Project Description

This is a classical Snake Game implemented by TypeScript.
1. User can control snake forward direction by arrow keys.
2. When eating food, snake body will increase one part and score will be added one simultaneously.
3. With default setting, user can level up by every ten scores and the speed of snake will accelerate accordingly. 
4. The max level is ten. So the speed is not indefinite to achieve better user experience.
